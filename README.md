In this study, we propose a novel stacking framework based on a hybrid of Gradient Boosting, Adaptive Boosting, and Multilayer Perceptron to predict accurately crash injury
severity on the traffic collision dataset provided by the Seattle City Department of Transportation from 2004 to 2021.  

## Dataset

**The Data-Set is Available in the link below:**

To download Dataset you can use this link: [Click Here](https://data-seattlecitygis.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/SeattleCityGIS::collisions/about). Download the dataset from Seattle City Department of Transportation and place it into the folder **data**.	


## Getting Started

**To run the script please use this file on Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook:**


```Codes``` folder contains all scripts used to train and test models. More details on how to train and test the code is mentioned inside ```Codes``` folder.
